CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindRTIMULib.h.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "RTIMULib.h", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "RTIMULib.h" with
  any of the following names:

    RTIMULib.hConfig.cmake
    rtimulib.h-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "RTIMULib.h" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "RTIMULib.h_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "RTIMULib.h" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
